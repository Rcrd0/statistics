## Principles of Analytic Graphics

Principles
* P1: show comparisons; compared to what?
* P2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure; what is the causal framework
* P3: Show multivariate data (>2 variables)
* P4: Integrate the evidence: word, numbers, tables, images, diagrams; don't let the tool drive the analysis
* P5: Describe and document the evidence: labels, scales, sources of data, source code
* P6: Content is king; what is the story you try to tell

## Exploratory Graphs (part1)

P3 Scope:
* Understand data properties
* Find patterns in data
* Suggest modeling strategies
* Debug analyses
* NO communicate results

P4 Characteristics
* Quick, personal understanding

P6 Data
* pollution <-read.csv("data/avgpm25.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "factor", "numeric", "numeric")

P7-15 One dimension
* summary(pollution$pm25)
* boxplot(pollution$pm25, col = "blue")
*    abline (h = 12)
* hist   (pollution$pm25, col = "green", breaks = 100)
*    rug(pollution$pm25)
*    abline(v = 12, lwd = 2)
*    abline(v = median(pollution$pm25), col = "magenta", lwd = 4)
* barplot(table(pollution$region), col = "wheat", main "Number of counties in each region")


## Exploratory Graphs (part 2)
P16 simple summaries of data
* Two dimensions: multiple/overlayed 1D (Lattice/ggplot2), scatterplots, smooth scatterplots
* > 2 dimensions: overlayed 2D; coplots, color, size, shape, spinning plots, 3D plots

P17 Multiple boxplots
* boxplot (pm25 - region, data = pollution, col = "red")

P18 Multiple histograms
* par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1))
*      hist(subset(pollution, region == "east")$pm25, col = "green")
*      hist(subset(pollution, regione == "west")$pm25, col = "green")

P19-20 Scatterplot
* with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25))
* with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25), col = region)
*      abline( h = 12, lwd = 2, lty = 2)

P21 Multiple scatterplots
* par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 2, 1))
*   with(subset(pollution, region == "west"), plot(latitude, pm25, main = "West"))
*   with(subset(pollution, region == "east"), plot(latitude, pm25, main = "East"))
